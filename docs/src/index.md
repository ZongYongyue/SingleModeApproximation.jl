# MeanFieldTheories.jl

**MeanFieldTheories.jl** is a Julia package for studying quantum many-body systems using mean-field theory and related methods. It provides a complete workflow from constructing many-body Hamiltonians to obtaining self-consistent ground states and calculating collective excitation spectra, covering methods such as Hartree-Fock (HF), Single-Mode Approximation (SMA) and Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

See documents: https://Quantum-Many-Body.github.io/MeanFieldTheories.jl

## Features

- **Fully customizable quantum system** Degrees of freedom (site, sublattice, spin, orbital, valley, …) are freely defined by the user via `SystemDofs`, with user-specified constraints.

-  **High flexibility for generating operator representations** DOF index constraints can be applied directly to `generate_onebody` and `generate_twobody` to select only the desired terms on each bond.

-  **Highly free forms of interaction** Two-body interaction allows four different site index $(i,j,k,l)$. The creation-annihilation ordering of the operator string is also arbitrary and handled automatically.

- **Unrestricted Hartree-Fock in both real and momentum space.** All four Wick contraction channels (Hartree and Fock, both pairs) are kept open with no preset symmetry breaking.

- **Complete post-HF excitation spectrum.** On top of the mean-field ground state, collective modes are accessible via Single-Mode Approximation (SMA) and Random Phase Approximation (RPA), yielding dynamic structure factors and excitation gaps directly.
