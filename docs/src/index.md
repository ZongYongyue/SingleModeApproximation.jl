# SingleModeApproximation.jl

**SingleModeApproximation.jl** is a Julia package for studying quantum many-body systems using the single-mode approximation (SMA) method. It provides a complete workflow from constructing many-body Hamiltonians to calculating collective excitations such as magnons, excitons and so on.

## Overview

The package implements a systematic approach to quantum many-body problems:

1. **Hamiltonian Construction**: Build many-body Hamiltonians with arbitrary degrees of freedom (spin, orbital, sublattice, valley, etc.) on various lattice geometries
2. **Hartree-Fock Approximation**: Obtain self-consistent ground states through mean-field treatment and variational minimization
3. **Single-Mode Approximation**: Calculate excitation spectra using momentum-dependent collective operators

This workflow follows the standard approach used in modern condensed matter physics, as exemplified in studies of topological magnons, spin-wave excitations, and collective modes in quantum materials.

## The Single-Mode Approximation Method

The single-mode approximation, introduced by Feynman (1954) for superfluid helium, is a powerful technique for studying collective excitations in interacting quantum systems. The key idea is to construct momentum-dependent operators that create elementary excitations from the ground state:

```
|k⟩ = Q†_k |Ψ₀⟩
```

where `Q†_k` is a collective operator (e.g., spin-flip operator for magnons) and `|Ψ₀⟩` is the Hartree-Fock ground state. The excitation energies are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem in the subspace of single-particle-hole excitations, often combined with the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) to include correlation effects beyond mean-field.

### Physical Applications

This approach is particularly useful for calculating:

- **Magnon spectra** in magnetic systems (spin waves)
- **Exciton spectra** in semiconductors and insulators
- **Plasmon spectra** in metallic systems
- **Collective modes** in topological materials

For example, in the context of twisted bilayer MoTe₂, the workflow proceeds as:
- Single-particle Hamiltonian (tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling)
- Mean-field calculation (Hartree-Fock self-consistency)
- Magnon spectrum (RPA excitations from the magnetic ground state)

## Key Features

## Quick Start

```julia
using SingleModeApproximation

# Define system with 4 sites and spin
dofs = SystemDofs(site=1:4, spin=[:up, :dn])

# Create a square lattice
lattice = Lattice(:Square, 2, 2, pbc=true)

# Generate nearest-neighbor hopping
bonds_nn = bonds(lattice, 1)
hopping = generate_onebody(dofs, bonds_nn, -1.0)

# Build Hamiltonian matrix
H = build_onebody_matrix(dofs, hopping)

# Diagonalize to get single-particle spectrum
using LinearAlgebra
eigenvalues = eigvals(Hermitian(H))
```
